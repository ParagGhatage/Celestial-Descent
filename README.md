## Overview

**Lunar Navigator** is a reinforcement learning project that explores the dynamics of landing a spacecraft on the lunar surface. Using the Gymnasium library and Stable Baselines3, this project aims to develop an agent capable of safely navigating the challenges of lunar landing.

## Objectives

- **Understanding Reinforcement Learning:** This project serves as an introductory exploration into the principles of reinforcement learning (RL).
- **Agent Development:** To create an intelligent agent that learns to land on the moon by iterating through its training environment.

## Key Features

- **Environment Setup:** Implementation of the lunar lander environment provided by Gymnasium.
- **Model Training:** Utilization of Stable Baselines3 to train the agent over 10,000 iterations.
- **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Addressing the critical balance during training to optimize the agentâ€™s landing performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Gymnasium
- Stable Baselines3
